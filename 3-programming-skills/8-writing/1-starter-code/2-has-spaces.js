  A user can input any text and they will be told if it has a space or not.
    - given the user cancels:
        they will be prompted again
    - given their input contains at least one space:
        they will be told so
    - given their input does not have any spaces:
        they will be told so

  test cases:
    contains no spaces:
      ''            ->  '"" has no spaces'
      'abc'         ->  '"abc" has no spaces'
      'hello'       ->  '"hello" has no spaces'
      'JavaScript'  ->  '"JavaScript" has no spaces'
    contains 1 space:
      ' '           ->  '" " has at least one space'
      ' abc'        ->  '" abc" has at least one space'
      'hello !'     ->  '"hello !" has at least one space'
      'Java Script' ->  '"Java Script" has at least one space'
    contains more than 1 space:
      '  '            ->  '"  " has at least one space'
      ' a b c '       ->  '" a b c " has at least one space'
      ' h e l l o ! ' ->  '" h e l l o ! " has at least one space'
      ' Java Script ' ->  '" Java Script " has at least one space'
