# Writing

It's time! Practice writing some programs of your own.

There are different levels of exercise in this folder, each with less support:

1. **Starter Code**: These exercises will give you behavior, goals and some
   starter code. You need to complete the code to implement the behavior
   described by the specs.
2. **Specs and Goals**: These exercises will have specs and labeled goals, but
   not starter code. You need to write all the code from scratch.
3. **Only Specs**: The final set of exercises will only give you the program
   specs, you need to come up with your own goals and your own code!

Some of the programs you will write are a lot like ones you studied in previous
chapters. No problem, just find a different way to write the same program
behavior!
