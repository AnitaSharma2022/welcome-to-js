# Commenting and Logging

Comments and logs are not complicated language features in JS, but knowing how
to use them well can take practice. The goal of commenting and logging is to
make the code more clear for other developers:

- **Comments**: _Static_ notes in the source code to help others understand how
  the code works and why it was written the way it was.
- **Logs**: _Dynamic_ information about what is happening inside the program
  while it is running.

This set of examples and exercises are just a start, with experience you will
find a balance between too much and too little commenting & logging. There are
also exercises in this module to study these skills more deeply.

## Variable Names

> 🐥 Do any of the programs in `./exercises` have the same variable use as a
> program in `../1-tracing-variables/exercises`?

Variable names _are **not** important for the computer_, as long as two programs
_use_ their variables the same way (think of the `?variables` lens) then the
programs are the same for the computer.

Variable names _**are** important for the developer_, if they are helpful a
variable's name can make it much easier for developers to understand a program.
