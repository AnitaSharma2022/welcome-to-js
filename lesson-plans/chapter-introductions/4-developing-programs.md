Practice modifying and writing programs.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Take a look through:
  - `/developing-programs/linting`
  - `/developing-programs/fixing-errors`

## During Class

Fix bugs and name variables.

### Before Break

- **All together**: read through `/developing-programs/fixing-bugs` and discuss how to find and fix bugs in a clear and structured way.
- **In Small Groups**: Fix some bugs!

### After Break

- **All together**: read through `/developing-programs/naming-variables` and discuss why variable names are important
- **In Small Groups**: practice giving variables _generic_ and _specific_ names

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Keep asking questions!

- 🥚 **[../flashcards](../flashcards)**: ~20 minutes every day
- 🥚🐣🐥🐔 Continue studying all the chapters in `/4-developing-programs`. No problems if you find it hard to write programs, in this module you are only expected to get the main ideas. Comfort will come with practice and time.
