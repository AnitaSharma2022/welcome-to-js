# 1. What is Programming?

Take a first look at programs and programming with JavaScript.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Look through [Suggested Study](../suggested-study.md)
  - _What is Programming?_
  - _What is JavaScript?_
- Watch [../printing-code.mp4](../printing-code.mp4)
- Play [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/) through level 15
- Study [../1-programming](../1-programming) through **1. Data in, Data Out**

## During Class

Learn the context surround a program (_users, developers & computers_), learn the basics of JS syntax, and learn how you can understand small programs.

## Before Break

- Q/A about "What is JavaScript?"
- How to open and study the module
- Break into small groups and study through:
  - [../1-programming/2-the-humans](../1-programming/2-the-humans)
  - [../1-programming/3-the-computer](../1-programming/3-the-computer)
  - [../1-programming/4-just-enough-syntax](../1-programming/4-just-enough-syntax)
- Gather together and each have each group share what they struggled with and what they learned

## After Break

- Return to small groups and study
  - [../1-programming/5-program-goals](../1-programming/5-program-goals)
  - [../1-programming/6-the-cat-detector](../1-programming/6-the-cat-detector) (if you have time)
- Gather together and each have each group share what they struggled with and what they learned

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas for what to focus on in this chapter:

- ü•ö [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/), üê£ [little-dot](http://little-dot.toxicode.fr/)
- ü•ö **[../flashcards](../flashcards)**: ~20 minutes every day (add more as you go!)
- ü•öüê£ Study the rest of `/1-what-is-programming`
