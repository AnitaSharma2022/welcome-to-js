/* ðŸ¥š Breakpoints

  use the [debug] button to pause this program in the devtools

  click on a line number to create a breakpoint
    you can create as many as you want
  you can now use the big blue triangle button -->
    this button will skip ahead to the next breakpoint

  practice setting breakpoints for:
    - each time the while loop checks is evaluated
    - each time `character` is declared
    - each time a character is checked for repeats
    - each time noRepeats is assigned a new value

  // here: only for `if`, not `includes`
