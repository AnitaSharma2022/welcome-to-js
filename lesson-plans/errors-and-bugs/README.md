before: errors

- when something is broken in your code program life cycle source code ->
  creation phase -> execution phase navigating errors in the console + debugger
  the structured comment

break

after: bugs

- when the program runs, but does not do what you expected

1. step through until you find something that surprises you
2. ask "why did that happen"?
3. trace backwards until you reach a line you want to try changing
4. make the change (comments and preserve the original line!)
5. run the program
6. repeat
