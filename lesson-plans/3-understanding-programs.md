### Before Break

Reading & Logging:

  practice using the "ask me" button to study a new program.
- **In Small Groups**: practice `/understanding-programs/logging-state`, this
  skill requires a few steps:
  - reading and understanding a program
  - understanding what data _should be_ logged
  - figuring out where in the program to write `console.log`

### After Break

Describing Programs:

- **All together**: read through **`/understanding-programs/describing`** and
  discuss how you can make sense of code you don't understand yet
- **In Small Groups**: practice describing programs

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Keep asking questions!
