# Programming: Lesson Plan

Begin learning JS syntax and vocabulary, reading code out loud, and tracing
variables.

## Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue
> in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

- Look through [Suggested Study](../suggested-study.md)
  - _What is Programming?_
  - _What is JavaScript?_
- Watch [../printing-code.mp4](../printing-code.mp4)
- Play [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/) through level 15
- Study the README, `0-javascript` and `1-the-humans` in this chapter.

## During Class

Learn different ways you can trace a program's execution.

## Before Break

- Q/A about "What is JavaScript?"
- How to open and study the module
- Begin studying [./2-the-computer](./2-the-computer) in small groups

## After Break

- Continue studying this chapter as far as you can in your small groups

## After Class

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas for
what to focus on in this chapter:

- 🥚 [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/), 🐣
  [little-dot](http://little-dot.toxicode.fr/)
- 🥚 **[../flashcards](../flashcards)**: ~20 minutes every day
- 🐣 Study through **The Cat Detector**
- 🐥 **More Cat Detectors**
