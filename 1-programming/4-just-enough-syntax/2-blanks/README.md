# Blanks

These exercises will randomly remove different syntax features from small
programs and replace them with blanks. You need to figure out what goes back in
each blank.

To help you focus your study you can select which syntax features to remove
(keywords, identifiers, operators, primitives), and how difficult you would like
the exercise to be.

You can check your answers using the _show diff_ option. This will highlight all
of the differences between your code and the original code.
