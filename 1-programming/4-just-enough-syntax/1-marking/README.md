# Marking

A good way to internalize JS syntax is to practice marking it on a page.
Printing code and marking on paper is a great way to go, but you can also do it
in your browser with the `?highlight` lens. This is how the exercises in this
folder will open.

Here's a quick guide for how to mark each piece of syntax, you can find images
of how to mark the code in `./examples`:

1. **Primitives**:A small arrow _under_ the primitive.
2. **Operators**: A small arrow _above_ on the operator.
3. **Identifiers**: A line _under_ the identifier.
4. **Keywords**: A line _over_ the keyword.
5. **Checks**: A half-box written over the check.
6. **Blocks**: A half-box written in the block's indentation.
7. **Function Calls**: A line under the identifier and a half-box under the
   arguments.

## `// prettier-ignore`

The exercises in this folder have an extra block around the code and a comment
written before the block. You can ignore that. It's there Prettier doesn't
remove the extra spacing when it formats the code.
