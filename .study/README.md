# Welcome to JS

## Learning Objectives

> all of these skills are limited to short, single-page programs written with
> **Just Enough JavaScript**

- 🥚 **Three Audiences**: You can explain how a single file of code is used to
  communicate with 3 different audiences:
  - **Developers**: You can explain how code formatting, comments, logs and
    variable names make it easier (or harder!) for a developer to understand a
    program.
  - **Computers**: You can explain how a computer follows your instructions to
    store, read and modify data in program memory.
  - **Users**: You can explain how the computer creates a dynamic user
    experience by following different executions paths depending on user input.
- 🥚 **Listening and Reading**: You can read code out loud, and understand your
  classmates when they read code to you. You don't need to understand how a
  program works to master these learning objectives!
  - **Listening** You can exactly re-write a program that a classmate has read
  - **Reading** You can read a program out loud and guide your classmates to
    re-write _exactly_ the same code without them seeing the program. \(every
    indentation, semi-colon, comment and spelling must be identical\) to you,
    without seeing the program they are reading.
- 🥚 **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: You can explain and use these two ways of
  studying a program, each can help you understand different aspects of your
  code. To help understand this concept, the _options_ panel in Study Lenses is
  organized into _static_ and _dynamic_ study options:
  - **Static**: Studying the text in a code file _without_ running it. Some
    static study methods are creating a flowchart, analyzing variables, filling
    out a trace table, and drawing on code.
  - **Dynamic**: _Running_ code and studying the computer's behavior. Some
    dynamic study methods are running code and reading console logs, using the
    _trace_ button, and stepping through in the debugger or JS Tutor.
- 🥚 **Analyzing Variables**: You can list all the variables in a program, and
  answer these 5 questions for each variable:
  - _Where is the variable declared?_
  - _What is the variable's scope?_
  - _Is the variable initialized with a value?_
  - _How many times is it's value used \(read\) in the program?_
  - _How many times is the variable assigned a new value?_
  - _What types are assigned to this variable during the program's execution?_
- 🐣 **Imperative Programming**: You can explain what the Imperative Programming
  paradigm is, and can explain how you know the programs in Welcome to JS are
  Imperative.
- 🐣 **Tracing Execution**: You can complete a "steps" trace table and correct
  your table using console output from the "trace" button.
- 🐣 **Logging**: You can tracing specific aspects of a program's execution and
  log them to the console.
- 🐣 **Completing Programs**: You can successfully fill in blanks for a program
  when the missing words are provided, including distractors.
- 🐣 **Describing Programs**: You can read a program and describe it with
  comments using to the methodology from `/describing-programs`: zooming out
  -&gt; zooming in -&gt; connections -&gt; goals
- 🐣 **Naming Variables**: You can analyze how a variable is used in a program
  and give it two names:
  - **Generic**: You can give a generic name to a variable based on how it is
    used in the program.
  - **Specific**: You can give a specific name to a variable based on how it's
    used _and_ the program's domain (the program's specific data and use-case).
- 🐥 **Constructing Programs**: You can reconstruct a program's lines and
  indentation, successfully ignoring distractor lines.
- 🐥 **Linting**: You can find and fix simple linting errors in JavaScript
  programs.
- 🐥 **Modifying Programs**: You can make small changes in a program to change
  it's behavior without breaking it.
- 🐔 **Stepping Through**: You can pause a script in a step debugger, arrange
  the debugger, collapse extra panels, and step through a script written with
  Just Enough JS. At each point in execution you can make a prediction of the
  next line before executing, and can check your prediction using the _scopes_
  panel.
- 🐔 **Writing Programs**: Given starter code with labeled goals, you can write
  a small program to match specs \(user stories + test cases\).

## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass
    tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is
  a very effective way to learn programming.
- Write lots of comments in the examples and exercises. The code in this
  repository is yours to study, modify and re-use in projects.
- Practice
  [Pair Programming](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/study-tips/pair-programming):
  two people, one computer.
- Take a look through the
  [Learning From Code](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/study-tips/learning-from-code)
  guide for more study tips

### Priorities

If you can't finish all the material in this repository, that's expected!
Anything you don't finish now will always be waiting for you to review when you
need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize your study time and to measure
your progress:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.

### Hashtags

There's so many examples and exercises in this repository, it's easy to forget
of what you still need to finish or what you want to review again. Luckily
VSCode is really good at searching through folders of code.

You can write hashtags in your comments while you're studying, then search for
those hashtags later so you don't miss anything. Here's some ideas:

- `// #todo, still a few blanks left` - search for `#todo` in Study Lenses or
  VScode to find all the exercises you still need to study
- `// #review, coercion is confusing this again next week` - search for
  `#review` to find the files you need to study again
- ... anything goes! Find the hashtags that work for you

### Study Board

Creating a project board on your GitHub account for tracking your study at HYF
can help you keep track of everything you're learning. You can create the board
at this link: `https://github.com/your_user_name?tab=projects`.

These 4 columns may be helpful:

- **todo**: material you have not studied yet
- **studying**: material you are currently studying
- **to review**: material you want to review again in the future
- **learned**: material you know well enough that you could help your classmates
  learn it
