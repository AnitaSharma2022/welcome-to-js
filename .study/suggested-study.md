## Be the Computer

These two games are deceptively simple. You will be given pseudo-code and will
need to follow the instructions the same way a computer would. Practicing this
game will help you learn how to trace code, and prepare you for learning about
program memory in the next module - Debugging.

## In This Repository

In this module you will only learn a small part of what JavaScript has to offer.
You will learn _just enough_ JavaScript to make small programs that process text
and interact with users. Why just enough, and not a little more? Because reading
and understanding program logic is more important than JavaScript, so why let
the code get in the way?

- 🥚🐣🐥🐔 **[../printables](../printables?--defaults)**: A collection of cheat
  sheets, diagrams, and other printable documents that can be helpful to keep by
  your computer. Print the ones you like, ignore the others.
- 🥚 **[../flashcards](../flashcards?--defaults)**: A collection of flashcards
  with key vocabulary and concepts for the module. You should study these every
  day.
- 🥚🐣🐥 **Programming**: What is a program? What is JavaScript? What is
  software development? This chapter is an introduction to all these big
  questions.
- 🥚🐣🐥🐔 **Just Enough JavaScript**: All the JavaScript you need to know to
  practice your programming skills.
  - 🥚 `/errors`: A quick read about what errors are and how you can undo them.
    The Debugging module will go into much more depth on errors.
  - 🥚 `/strict-mode`: A quick read and a couple examples. long story short:
    always use strict mode.
  - 🥚🐣🐥🐔 ... just enough JavaScript ...
  - 🐔 `/explorations`: Experiment with JS language features that interest you,
    try modifying the programs in this repo, or try writing your own. This
    folder is yours to explore JS and programming.
- 🥚🐣🐥🐔 **Programming Skills**:
  - 🥚 `/reading`: Practice reading interactive programs. This includes
    identifying variables, tracing code like the computer, drawing on the code,
    and asking good questions.
  - 🥚 `/plain-text-programs`: JavaScript programs written in `.txt` files that
    have no color. How is it different to study?
  - 🥚 `/logging`: Learn how to create your own trace of a program's execution
    using `console.log`. Practice tracing different aspects of the same
    program's execution.
  - 🐣 `/describing`: Analyze programs in detail learning to explain what is
    happening on each line, and explaining how each line contributes to the
    program's overall behavior.
  - 🐣 `/naming-variables`: Code should be written for people first, computers
    second. Learn to give helpful names to your variables that describe what
    data they store and how they are used in your program.
  - 🐥 `/modifying`: A few working programs with challenges for how to change
    it's behavior. Each exercise comes with a few files: the original, and one
    extra file for each challenge. If you get lost in an exercise you you can
    copy-type the original to start over.
  - 🐔 `/writing`: Practice writing programs from spec with different amounts of
    support.
